# MedianFilterVHDL
FPGA simulation code that reads the salt-and-pepper noisy image pixel values ​​printed to a text file, applies a median filter, and prints the filtered image pixels to a new file. Salt and pepper noise was added to the image in Matlab and the pixels of this image were printed to the text file. This text file is used as input_image.txt in FPGA simulation.
